Welcome to the Godot base project for the CoForge pilot game: Shattered Realms. This repository is structured to support collaborative, modular development using Godot 4.x.



🛠 Getting Started
Download or clone this folder to your machine
💡 “Download” means:
Go to the Shared Google Drive
Locate the folder named Godot_base_project
Right-click the folder and select “Download”
Extract the ZIP file on your computer
You'll now have a local folder containing the full project structure (scenes, scripts, etc.)
“Clone” means using Git to copy the project from GitHub (for developers who are comfortable with Git).
In both cases, the goal is to obtain a local copy of the project that you can open with Godot Engine.
Open Godot Engine (version 4.x)
Click "Import Project" and select project.godot
Launch the project and open any scene to start contributing

🧩 How to Contribute
Pick an open task from the Notion board
Create your feature in a new test scene inside /tests/
Use clear naming: test_inventory.tscn, npc_dialogue.gd...
When ready, share your work for review:
Via GitHub (pull request)
Or via Discord (#shattered-realms channel)
Please do not edit main.tscn directly unless you're in charge of scene integration.
